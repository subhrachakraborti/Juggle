## Description

**Juggle** is an agentic AI financial coach designed to move beyond simple, backward-looking expense tracking. Our solution directly tackles the core challenge of the **MumbaiHacks 2025 Fintech track** by creating a proactive agent that helps users, particularly those with volatile incomes, manage the complex interplay between their daily spending, recurring bills, and future life events.

Instead of just showing users where their money _went_, Juggle provides **financial foresight**, showing them where their money _needs to go_. It acts as a personal financial coach that continuously learns a user's habits to anticipate future cash flow challenges and opportunities, transforming financial anxiety into actionable, forward-looking plans.

## How Juggle Works: From Data to Foresight

Juggle's intelligence is built on a unified view of a user's financial and personal life. The process is simple for the user but powered by a sophisticated backend agent:

1.  **Secure Data Integration**: The user securely connects their bank accounts (for transaction data) and their Google Calendar (for event data). This creates a comprehensive picture of both their financial history and their upcoming commitments.

2.  **AI-Powered Analysis**: Our AI agent gets to work, performing several key tasks:
    * **Transaction Categorization**: It intelligently categorizes spending to understand financial habits.
    * **Event Identification**: It scans the calendar for significant events—birthdays, anniversaries, festivals, travel plans, and bill due dates.
    * **Income Pattern Recognition**: It analyzes historical data to learn the user's income patterns, whether they are fixed monthly salaries or the fluctuating payments of a gig worker.

3.  **Proactive Forecasting & Intervention**: This is the core of Juggle's agentic nature. The AI synthesizes all this information to model the user's future cash flow. It doesn't just send a simple reminder. Instead, it provides proactive, contextual advice.
    * **Example Intervention**: _"Heads up! Next month you have Diwali expenses, your car insurance premium, and a friend's wedding coming up. Based on your typical income, I project a potential shortfall of ₹7,000. Let's start an automated micro-savings plan of ₹250 per day to cover it without stress."_

## The Agentic Core: More Than Just an App

The central theme of MumbaiHacks 2025 is "Agentic AI," and Juggle is designed specifically to meet this mandate. Our solution is not just an app that _uses_ AI; it is an app where the AI _acts_ as an agent on the user's behalf.

* **Continuous Learning**: The agent's recommendations become smarter over time. It learns which events are high-priority, understands seasonal spending spikes, and adapts its forecasts as a user's income and habits evolve.
* **Proactive Risk Identification**: The agent's primary function is to identify financial risks _before_ they become problems. It looks for budget conflicts and potential cash flow gaps weeks or even months in advance.
* **Personalized Recommendations**: All advice is tailored to the individual. The agent understands the user's unique financial situation and delivers recommendations that are realistic and achievable.
